****Comments:****
The player who took the samples was not expert in playing this game. It was useful to take samples of poor driving in order to learn how to recover from a mistake.
The prediction works better when the same character (RAZER) is selected during a run.
The prediction does not work for different Races and Tracks, as the samples for training only include images and actions for the mentioned Race and Track.
The prediction also performs well in Champion Class.
From the training result, looks like with the current samples it is not clear when to trigger the "RIGHT" category (turning right without accelerating).
Highest F1 scores are for ACCEL, LEFT+ACCEL and RIGHT+ACCEL classes.
